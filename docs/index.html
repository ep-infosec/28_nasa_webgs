        <article><h1>WEB GS</h1>
<p>Web GS is a Browser based ground control station that is compatible with Icarous and capable of multi-aircraft simulations.</p>
<p>After cloning this repository run git <code>submodule update --init --recursive</code> to clone the submodules.</p>
<p>Python3 is required to run the socket server. After python3 is installed, install the required packages:</p>
<pre><code>cd into the webgs directory
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre>
<p>To start a basic http server:
Make sure you have installed node.js and npm. https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
Then install a simple http-server: https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server</p>
<pre><code>cd into the webgs directory
http-server -p 8082 -i
</code></pre>
<p>Webgs is configured to use mapbox for the background display. It is free to use for non commercial purposes. To get an authorization key go to https://www.mapbox.com/ and create an account. After receiving an authorization token open /webgs/MainJS/MapSettings.js in a text editor, and follow the instructions to update.</p>
<p>To start the web socket server:</p>
<pre><code>Open a terminal and cd into the webgs directory
python3 multiprocess_server.py
</code></pre>
<p>In a web browser (preferably a current version of chrome) navigate to <code>localhost:8082</code></p>
<p>There are some compatibility issues with other browsers. These issues are mainly just styling. There may be some weird colors, or things may be slightly out of place.</p>
<p>To connect to the server from another device (only if on the same local network):</p>
<pre><code>If the web server and socket server are on another device on your local network. *The server is not public facing, and will not be seen by anyone outside of the local network.
1. Enter the ip address of the machine running the web server into the browser address bar in format - ip:8082
2. From the settings panel Under Connect to Remote Host, change the IP Address to the device the socket server is running on (The port should not change). Then Press the Create New Connection button.
</code></pre>
<p>Connect WebGS to Jetson/PX4 over UDP:</p>
<pre><code>Assuming Icarous is configured properly:
1. Ensure you are on the same network as the device running Icarous. Typically this will involve changing the IP address of your machine.
2. Start the web server and the socket server. Ensure the Web page is connected to the socket server.
3. In the settings panel, set:
    GCS Mode -&gt; 'Connect to Hardware'
    Select Input Type -&gt; IP
    IP Address -&gt; {the same IP address Icarous is configured to output to}
4. Ensure the Port and Baud Rate are correct.
5. Press connect to aircraft.
</code></pre>
<p>Connect WebGS to Jetson/PX4 via Serial USB Device:</p>
<pre><code>Assuming Icarous is configured properly:
1. Ensure you are on the same network as the device running Icarous. Typically this will involve changing the IP address of your machine.
2. Start the web server and the socket server. Ensure the Web page is connected to the socket server.
3. In the settings panel, set:
    GCS Mode -&gt; 'Connect to Hardware'
    Select Input Type -&gt; USB
    IP Address -&gt; {the same IP address Icarous is configured to output to}
4. Ensure the Port and Baud Rate are correct.
5. Press connect to aircraft.
</code></pre>
<p>To run simulations:</p>
<pre><code>1. Icarous must be installed and properly built.
2. On the settings page ensure

    GCS Mode is set to 'SITL'
    Path to icarous is set correctly
    Path to Ardupilot is set correctly (if needed)

3. Change icarous startup apps if needed.
4. Then either right click on the map or click on the Aircraft button and select 'New Aircraft'
5. The default parameters for Icarous in version 2 are auto loaded by the ground station. They may need to be changed.
</code></pre>
<p>To view own-ship perspective flight instruments:</p>
<pre><code>After the aircraft has started, click Open DAA Display. This will open the display in a new tab. This is currently only configured to show information for Aircraft 1. Currently this display only works on port 8082. If the server was launched on another port the map will not be displayed.
</code></pre>
<p>Playback - Webgs uses the MAVProxy format for creating .tlog files for each flight. These files along with the Server logs, Icarous outputs, ardupilot outputs, and a text file containing all of the received mavlink messages are stored in the LogFiles directory. To playback a file:</p>
<pre><code>1. Change the GCS Mode to Playback
2. Enter the file name in the text box. (It assumes files will be located in the LogFiles directory.)
3. Click Start Playback. It may take a few seconds to load the file.

Note: I would not recommend fast forwarding at the beginning of the file. If you miss the flight plan messages, a flight plan will not show up on the map.
</code></pre>
<p>Merging .tlog files for multi-aircraft playback:</p>
<pre><code>1. A Python3 script has been included for creating a .mlog file that webgs is capable of playing.
2. It is located in webgs/ServerFiles/
3. python3 mergeTlogs.py -h or --help for instructions on how to use it.
</code></pre>
<p>Fly By File - Webgs is capable of flying scripted scenarios that are repeatable and adjustable. Functionality is still limited but it has been tested with four simulated aircraft flying simultaneously, each with multiple intruders and a geofence, repeated 50 times, adjusting parameters, flight plans, and intruders after 25 flights. Examples and instructions on building a script are located in <code>/webgs/Examples/TestScripts</code>.</p>
<p>Other tips and tricks:</p>
<pre><code>1. To run Icarous without sudo the mqueue max_size must be raised from the default of 10.

    To check the current setting:
    cat /proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msg_max

    To change the value:
    sudo sh -c &quot;echo 500 &gt; /proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msg_max&quot;

2. Ardupilot has issues with multi-aircraft simulations. I would recommend using the rotor sim that comes with Icarous.

3. Rotorsim auto snaps to way point 1 when the flight plan is submitted. Take that into consideration when planning a mission.
